# ASSETTO is a Decentralised IMP DOC storage DAPP Build on Nervous Network Blockchain

## What is really is ASSETTO ?

<Strong>ASSETTO</Strong> is a Decentralised DAPP Build on <Strong>NERVOUS NETWORK BLOCKCHAIN</Strong> to <Strong>STORE AND RETRIEVE</Strong>
Important and Confedential <Strong>ASSET/DOC/FILE etc. It is basically a Storage Management Platform</Strong> which is Super Easy to Use with an Eye Catchy UI and Awesome UX.

## We are using different Tech Stack to achieve it

 1)We have Create a <Strong>FRONTEND</Strong> with the help of <Strong>CREATE-REACT-APP(CRA)</Strong> using Hooks and web3context to optimise the performance and using <Strong>pw-SDK</Strong> from nervous network platform.

 2)We have used Solidity to create <Strong>SMART CONTRACT</Strong> (FOR OUR LOGIC) to store different important docs on the <Strong>NERVOUS NETWORK BLOCKCHAIN.</Strong>

 3)We have used <Strong>Truffle framework with Ganache</Strong> to test our DApp on local Enviornment.

 4)We have used <Strong>GODWOKEN L2 TESTNET</Strong> to Deploy our DAPP and implemented Succesfull Transactions for our DApp.

 5)We have used <Strong>IPFS API(BY INFURA)</Strong> to Upload,Retrieve etc our Docs on the DECENTRALISED PLATFORM as AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)
   encryption is used to encrypt data before uploading to IPFS(Inter Planetary File System).

 6)We have used used <Strong>METAMASK & CONNECT WALLET</Strong> for CKB transaction through our integration with <Strong>pw-core(pw-SDK).</Strong>

 7)We have used <Strong>CKB TestNetwork and Nervos Aggron Faucet</Strong> to burn some CKB.

 8)We have used NETIFY fro HOSTING purposes.

## How to Use this DAPP ?

 1)Install npx/npm/yarn and CRA.

 2)Install the necessary <Strong>DEPENDENCIES</Strong> used in the DApp by npm i.

 3)Then the dapp on local host by npm start.

 4)Connect your Web3 Wallet with application <Strong>(METAMASK,WALLETCONNECT OPTIONS)-->Connect to your NERVOUS NETWORK WALLET.</Strong>

 5)Now you can <Strong>UPLOAD,RETRIEVE,CREATE,STORE</Strong> etc any imp Document/File/Image etc on the <Strong>NERVOUS NETWORK BLOCKCHAIN</Strong> with   a <Strong>HASH KEY.</Strong>

 6)Now after succesful transaction with a negligible fee you can use this <Strong>HASH KEY</Strong> in the form of a RECEIPT certificate for future use.

 7)Later on we can <Strong>CHECK FOR THE AUTHENTICITY OF ANY DOC/FILE/ASSET</Strong> etc ON CHAIN WITH JUST THE <Strong>HASH KEY.</Strong>
